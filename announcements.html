<h1>Announcements at up.front</h1>

<p>
  Hello there,
</p>

<p>
  thanks for your interest in making an announcement at up.front. We have very limited slots for short community announcements at each event. They are usually given at the beginning of the event or after the break. Please make sure you stay within the following requirements:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Announcements shouldnâ€™t be longer than 1-2 minutes.</li>
  <li>You should not have more than 3 slides.</li>
  <li>Announcement slots are reserved for community projects that subscribe to similar standards as up.front, e.g. community meetups, workshops or open source projects that follow a Code of Conduct and commit to safety and diversity.</li>
</ul>

</p>
  If you would like to request an announcement slot please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> at least a day in advance.
