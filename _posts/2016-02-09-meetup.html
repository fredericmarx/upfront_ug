      title: 'Great Branding Is Storytelling'
      picture: 'nadine-bruder.jpg'
      desc: 'Two things that Nadine regularly encounters in her work: a lot of people presume that branding is all about the visual identity of a company, and that people strongly underestimate the impact of stories. But in a digital age both, branding and storytelling are crucial for companies to connect with their audiences. In her talk Nadine will share her experiences and insights into strategic branding and storytelling, explain how both are linked and how to create true, meaningful connections between a brand and its audiences.'
      bio: 'Nadine is a brand and digital business strategist consulting lifestyle and technology companies on branding, UX, storytelling, marketing and product strategy. She is drawn to people and places that value good design, useful innovation and meaningful connections.'
