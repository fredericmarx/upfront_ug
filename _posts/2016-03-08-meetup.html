  talks:
    - name: 'Matteo Cavucci'
      title: 'Better User Stories'
      picture: 
      desc: 'One of the biggest challenges of building things together is communicating your idea to others. Considering that humans are not so great at telepathy, the only tool we have is language. For years, the solution was struggling to collect all the requirements in big spec books that noone wanted to read. Until we discovered another way: telling stories. This talk is taking a familiar format, the "user story", and will explore it from an unusual point of view. We’re going to see how to use it, how to avoid common pitfalls and how to make real sense of "user stories".'
      bio: '​Matteo is a true web-midfielder. Developer at heart, his passion is bridging engineering, design and digital strategy. He’s motivated by both product and technical challenges, getting excited by discovering new features as well as Agile practices. After more than ten years in the web industry, he’s currently working at Edenspiekermann, where he’s helping clients and teammates to build great products and services.'

It is an important experience in decision making and this talk will offer a basic guideline to approach this challenge.'
